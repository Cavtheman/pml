We want to show that, with the following definitions, the Wiener Process is not a random Process, according to Kolmogorov's Consistency Theorem.
\begin{align*}
  &f_0=0, x_0=0 \\
  &f_{i+1}=f_i+W_i, W_i \sim N\left(0, \sqrt{x_{i+1}-x_i}\right)
\end{align*}
We use that definition of $K = ADA^T$ from the slides, with all that follows. As such, we have a definition for each index $K_{ij}$, with the modified definition from above:
\begin{align*}
  K_{ij} &= \sum_{I=1}^i \sqrt{x_I - x_{I-1}} \mathbb{I}\{I\leq j\} \\
  &= \sum_{I=1}^{\text{min}\{i,j\}}\sqrt{x_I - x_{I-1}} \\
  &\centernot = x_{\text{min}\{i,j\}}
\end{align*}
We see that we cannot do the same reduction as in the slides, $\sum_{I=1}^{\text{min}\{i,j\}}(x_I - x_{I-1}) = x_{\text{min}\{i,j\}}$. Because the expression cannot be reduced to something that does not depend on all previous values, we see that it is not possible for a subset $T$ to have the property that:
\begin{align*}
  p(f_T|T) = \int p(f_T,f_C|S) \text{d}f_C
\end{align*}
As such, we have proven that this modified Wiener Process is not a random process.
